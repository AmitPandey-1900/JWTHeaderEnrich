Explanation:
##Gradle Build File (build.gradle):
Configures the Spring Boot project with necessary dependencies.
##Bootstrap YAML (bootstrap.yml):
Configures Spring Cloud Kubernetes to reload configuration properties.
##Application YAML (application.yml):
Defines the clientusermapping.file.path property with a default value that can be overridden by the environment variable CLIENT_USER_MAPPING_FILE_PATH.
##ClientIdService Class:
Reads properties from the ConfigMap and caches them.
The properties file path is injected from the configuration.
##Kubernetes ConfigMap:
Defines the properties to be loaded.
##Kubernetes Deployment:
Configures the application to load the ConfigMap as environment variables and sets the CLIENT_USER_MAPPING_FILE_PATH environment variable.
By following these steps, you can ensure that the properties file path is configurable and can be overridden, providing flexibility and ease of management.
